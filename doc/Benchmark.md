# Built in benchmarks using the terminal

DXRAM comes with built in micro benchmarks for different modules of the system. The benchmarks are implemented as compute tasks for the [*MasterSlaveComputeService*](Tasks.md). Multiple tasks can be scripted and started from the [DXRAM terminal](Terminal.md).

The *script/compute* folder contains a collection of tasks split into different categories (refer to [the readme](../script/compute/README.md)). The sub-folder *bench* contains scripts to run different benchmarks.
