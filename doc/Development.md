# How to get started

DXRAM provides different ways to either quickly implement and run algorithms or full applications on top of the DXRAM core. Each method has its benefits and addresses different application requirements.

## Applications

Full control for all types of applications running on one or multiple DXRAM peers. See [this document](Applications.md).

## Tasks

Don't worry about deployment to multiple DXRAM peers and synchronization: If you have a pipeline that can be split into separate tasks that require a synchronization step between each task, this is the right choice. See [this document](Tasks.md).

## Jobs

The lightweight solution: Suitable for small algorithms and short running calculations. See [this document](Jobs.md).
